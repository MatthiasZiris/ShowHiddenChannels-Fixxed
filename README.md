# ShowHiddenChannels-Fixxed
ShowHiddenChannels is a plugin for BetterDiscord that allows users to view information about hidden channels in a Discord server, such as their name, description and which roles or users have access to these hidden channels. Please note that this plugin will not allow you to read the messages in these channels, it will only show you information about them.

The original plugin by @rauenzi was discontinued and removed from the official BetterDiscordAddons repository, so this plugin was created to fill that void.

If you are searching for the Replugged version of this plugin, there is one made by LoneWeeb you can find it here.
